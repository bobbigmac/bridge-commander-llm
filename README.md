## Bridge Commander

Give the text files to your LLM, then on "Captain on the bridge", enable voice mode.

If your LLM stalls or gets into a loop, ask for a report and nudge it back to the game.

GPT-5 seems to be tuned to avoid confrontation, so you might have more success with less controlled engines.

### GPT Kinda Sucks

I Setup a 'GPT' for this, but it struggles to contextualise the files (maybe due to load), for best results...

1. Copy the content from 00_start_prompt.md as the text of your message

2. Attach the files 1-5 to the input

3. Submit and wait for "Captain on the bridge"

4. Activate voice mode and ask "What's our Mission?", then go from there.
