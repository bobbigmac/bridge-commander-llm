## Bridge Commander

If your LLM stalls or gets into a loop, ask for a report and nudge it back to the game.

GPT-5 seems to be tuned to avoid confrontation or drama, other engines might do better. I tried Grok but it can't even ingest the context properly.

### How to Run

I setup [a 'GPT' called Bridge Commander](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68a7451d4ba08191a7e48b046d39dd2d-bridge-commander?model=gpt-5), but it struggles to contextualise the files (maybe due to load), for best results...

1. Copy the content from 00_start_prompt.md as the text of your message

2. Attach the files 1-5 to the input

3. Submit and wait for "Captain on the bridge"

4. Activate voice mode and ask "What's our Mission?", then go from there.
