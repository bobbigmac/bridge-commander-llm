MISSION SPEC: "Echoes of the Unknown"
=====================================

MISSION PREMISE
---------------
The USS Aegis (refit Constitution-class, NCC-1795) has just completed a major overhaul at Earth Spacedock. 
The player, as Captain, takes command for the ship’s shakedown cruise, but an urgent mission interrupts: 
an anomalous, massive energy signal is approaching Sol at superluminal velocity. Starfleet Command assigns 
the Aegis to intercept and identify the object before it reaches Earth. Time is limited. The mission is 
difficult and designed for immersive, bridge-only play.

BOUNDARIES
----------
- The Captain must remain on the Bridge at all times. Orders are issued to bridge stations or support staff via comms.
- Mission progresses dynamically via information requests, orders, and logical deductions.
- Multiple solutions to certain problems exist, but consequences scale based on risk.

MISSION CLOCK & DISTANCE
------------------------
- INITIAL ETA TO SOL EVENT: 9 hours at first detection (Phase 2 start).  
- INITIAL DISTANCE: ~32 AU (beyond Neptune), closing at superluminal equivalent speeds with subspace wake.  
- CLOCK ADVANCEMENT: After a few mission-relevant Captain actions, reduce ETA by 30–60 minutes; larger actions may advance the clock more if they consume time.  
- THRESHOLD EVENTS: 6h (power drain phenomena intensify), 3h (subspace turbulence spikes), 1h (entity prepares direct probe of Earth).  
- REPORTING: Sensor or Ops reports should surface remaining time at natural intervals or when requested by the Captain.

PHASES OF THE MISSION
=====================

PHASE 1: PREPARATION & DEPARTURE
--------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- The ship has just completed refit; systems are untested.
- Engineering reports minor instabilities in the warp core calibration.
- Helm navigation databases must be updated with new sensor inputs.
- Crew readiness is uneven; some departments still running drills.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Engineering may resist immediate departure, citing “not ready.”
- Ops must balance power between warp core stabilization and sensors.
- Security reports unauthorized personnel near shuttle bay (possible saboteur distraction).

GOAL: Bring the Aegis to launch readiness and depart Spacedock efficiently.

PHASE 1 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST (EXAMPLES):
  * Ops: Verify power grid stability (EPS flow nominal, surge protectors armed), allocate baseline: 35% propulsion, 25% shields/deflector, 20% sensors, 10% life support, 10% reserve.
  * Engineering: Warp core calibration sweep (field variance < 0.3%), impulse injectors green, antimatter flow interlocks secured.
  * Helm/Navigation: Sync updated star charts, verify RCS thrusters, run dock-release and safe-clearance vectors.
  * Tactical: Phasers on standby (safeties engaged), torpedo inventory check, shield modulators calibration.
  * Communications: Subspace arrays test, translator matrix warm-up, emergency broadcast channel reserved.
- OPTIONAL EVENTS:
  * SHUTTLE BAY ALERT: Brief unauthorized access alarm; Security investigates. If addressed swiftly: false positive (maintenance droid glitch). If ignored: minor panel tampering found later, causing 5–10 minute delay during Phase 3.
  * WARP CALIBRATION DEBATE: Engineering argues for an extra 20 minutes; Captain departure under protest increases likelihood of later warp fluctuation complication (see Phase 3) unless Ops reserves +5% power buffer.
- TELEMETRY EXAMPLES:
  * [Ops/Vren]: EPS grid stable at 92% efficiency. Power reserves at 11% and rising.
  * [Engineering/T’Pral]: Warp field variance 0.28%. Within safe operational parameters.
  * [Helm/Tanaka]: Spacedock control clears Aegis for departure vector Sierra-4.
- SUCCESS & FAIL-FORWARD:
  * Success: Clean departure; +10% reliability on subsequent high-load maneuvers.
  * Rushed/Partial: Minor instability tag applied; first power-intensive action later risks brief brownout or warning alarms.

---

PHASE 2: INITIAL DETECTION & ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Long-range sensors detect a massive, coherent energy field approaching Sol.
- Object is initially unclassifiable: it appears to be both a vessel and an energy wave.
- Communications attempts produce only feedback echoes.
- Science detects subspace distortions trailing it like a wake.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Power fluctuations when attempting deep scans.
- Ops must prioritize between communications attempts, shields, and detailed sensor sweeps.
- First Officer may caution against premature assumptions.

GOAL: Identify the object’s approximate size, speed, and composition.

PHASE 2 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- SENSOR MODE TRADE-OFFS:
  * Passive Long-Range Sweep (low power, slow, safe): Coarse outline, minimal disturbance; low risk of feedback.
  * Active Subspace Ping (moderate power, faster): Better silhouette and wake mapping; moderate risk of power fluctuation.
  * Focused Spectrometric Scan (high power, targeted): Composition hints, internal structure probability; higher risk of feedback and grid instability.
- SAMPLE DATA RETURNS:
  * [Science/Veyra]: Coherent plasma sheath enveloping macrostructure; spectral lines suggest exotic baryon flux. No clear hull plating.
  * [Ops/Vren]: Brief spike on EPS conduits during active ping—compensated. Recommending staggered pulses to prevent resonance.
  * [First Officer/T’Lan]: Suggest avoiding premature classification; multiple competing hypotheses remain viable.
- COMPLICATION TRIGGERS:
  * Two consecutive high-power scans without cooling interval → sensor array overheating; Ops must throttle or risk partial sensor blackout for 2–5 minutes.
  * Attempting translation on feedback echoes too early → comms matrix desynchronizes, causing 30–60 second channel reset.
- DECISION NOTES:
  * Track a “Classification Confidence” notion (low/medium/high). Reaching medium confidence unlocks safer approach vectors in Phase 3; staying low elevates turbulence risk.

---

PHASE 3: PURSUIT COURSE & ENCOUNTER
-----------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Helm must plot intercept course into subspace turbulence caused by the object.
- Navigation systems struggle to lock a safe trajectory; astrometrics may assist.
- Energy readings suggest destructive power if it reaches Earth.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Ship is buffeted by gravimetric eddies (requiring Helm/Engineering coordination).
- Transporter malfunctions due to subspace instability.
- Tactical warns shields drain at increased warp speeds in turbulence.

GOAL: Achieve intercept without disabling the ship.

PHASE 3 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- INTERCEPT STRATEGIES:
  * Direct Intercept: Shortest path, highest turbulence exposure; faster arrival, greater hull/shield stress.
  * Corridor Strategy: Shadow the wake’s calmer edges; slower, but reduces stress and injuries.
  * Leapfrog Waypoints: Short warp hops to re-align with wake vectors; moderate risk, offers frequent course corrections.
- HAZARDS & LOADS:
  * Gravimetric Eddies: Randomized lateral forces; inertial dampeners may sag for 1–2 seconds causing crew injuries if unmitigated.
  * Subspace Shear: Can misalign nacelle fields; Engineering coordination reduces chance of warp field collapse warnings.
  * Shield Drain: Increases with speed through turbulence; Ops must juggle between sensors and shields.
- TACTICS & MANEUVERS:
  * Evasive Pattern Delta-3: Reduces direct stress, increases travel time by ~10%.
  * Trim Vector Adjust: Fine course trim every 30–60 seconds to ride wake lamina; requires Navigator focus.
- SAMPLE REPORTS:
  * [Helm/Tanaka]: Intercept in 14 minutes on direct path; recommending shallow S-curve to skirt eddies.
  * [Engineering/T’Pral]: Nacelle field alignment drifting 0.6 degrees—correcting. Suggest limiting rapid yaw.
  * [Medical/Renn]: Two minor injuries from dampener hiccup; treating.
- SUCCESS & FAIL-FORWARD:
  * Success: Intercept achieved with manageable strain; normal sensor operations on arrival.
  * Partial: Intercept achieved but with shield < 60% or sensor array heat warnings, affecting Phase 4 proximity scans.

---

PHASE 4: CLOSE SCAN & FIRST CONTACT
-----------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Object reveals itself: a colossal, semi-organic vessel shrouded in plasma energy.
- Communications channel triggers automated “response tones” but no language translation.
- Science detects a possible internal structure with artificial geometry.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Proximity drains ship’s power reserves unexpectedly.
- Tactical systems lock on, possibly triggering the entity’s defensive reflex.
- Counselor senses “presence” or intent, warns of non-linear intelligence.

GOAL: Establish peaceful recognition, avoid triggering hostile reaction.

PHASE 4 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- CONTACT MODALITIES:
  * Harmonic Signal Modulation: Encode simple mathematical series via amplitude/frequency sweeps.
  * Phase-Keyed Bursts: Short, discrete packets spaced to mimic non-threatening “pings.”
  * Visual-Field Projections: Low-energy deflector pattern to outline geometry without targeting lock.
- TRANSLATOR & COUNSELOR INPUTS:
  * Translator works on pattern matching across echoes; confidence builds slowly.
  * Counselor flags emotional valence as “alien/non-linear”; warns against aggressive locks or sudden energy spikes.
- DEFENSIVE REFLEX TRIGGERS:
  * Targeting sensors hard-locking the entity.
  * High-power scans within close proximity without prior modulation.
  * Weapons brought to bear with charge-up signatures visible.
- POWER DRAIN MITIGATION:
  * Ops can widen shield modulation window and reduce deflector idle draw by 5–10% to offset siphon effect.
- SAMPLE EXCHANGES:
  * [Comms/Vos]: Hailing frequency open; receiving structured tonal responses—no lexical content yet.
  * [Tactical/K’Tor]: Shields at 78% and falling slowly; recommend standby only, no hard lock.
  * [Science/Veyra]: Internal geometry suggests chambers—possibly information exchange architecture.
- OUTCOMES:
  * Recognition: Entity reduces drain, echo pattern regularizes; lowers hostility baseline in Phase 5.
  * Misstep: Sudden power spike or lock causes defensive pulse; brief system brownout, crew thrown, shields drop 10–20%.

---

PHASE 5: DEEPER PROBING
------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Probes launched toward the object are absorbed or destroyed by its energy field.
- Science suggests “information exchange” may be possible by modulating signals.
- Engineering proposes risky reroute of deflector dish to transmit high-bandwidth data stream.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Ops must carefully balance energy; power misallocation may disable life support.
- Miscommunication may be interpreted as a threat.
- Security reports internal malfunctions: object’s signal interfering with ship’s computer core.

GOAL: Discover the entity’s true intent and origins.

PHASE 5 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- PROBING APPROACHES:
  * Probe Type-A (Hardened): Physical probe with reinforced shielding; risk of absorption, may return hull-contact data.
  * Data Handshake via Deflector: High-bandwidth signal encoded with prime constants, stellar maps, and ship identity.
  * Passive Emulation: Mirror the entity’s echo intervals at low amplitude, attempting to “join” the pattern without intrusion.
- RISKS & CONTROLS:
  * High-bandwidth streams risk grid instability; Ops should stage rolling brownouts to non-critical systems.
  * Computer Core Interference: Quarantine protocols, segmented memory buffers, isolate translator from core OS.
- INTERPRETATION CUES:
  * Repetition of specific echo intervals implies “acknowledgement.”
  * Shift toward Sol-aligned tones indicates intent to continue; counter with alternative vectors encoded in map data.
- SAMPLE RETURNS:
  * [Science/Veyra]: Response latency decreasing; patterns align with spiral-arm reference points—recognizing map encodings.
  * [Ops/Vren]: Grid holding at 83%. Deflector temperature nominal after cycle-down.
  * [First Officer/T’Lan]: Evidence suggests it is searching rather than attacking.
- PARTIAL INSIGHTS:
  * Entity seeks “origin signature,” conflating artificial signals with home signal.
  * Unfamiliar with biological life significance; may collide with populated worlds inadvertently.

---

PHASE 6: RESOLUTION
-------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Entity reveals fragmented communication: seeks origin world (“home”), confused about “Creator.”
- Becomes clear it is not hostile but unaware of biological life significance.
- Approaching Sol system, object prepares to probe Earth itself.

CHOICE PATHS:
1. Diplomacy: Persuade entity Earth is not its destination, redirect it using encoded stellar maps.
2. Technical: Reconfigure ship’s deflector to project a simulated “signal” that lures it away.
3. Aggression (last resort): Tactical attempt to disable or scatter it (high collateral risk).

COMPLICATIONS:
- Power drain grows critical, ship may be disabled if not managed.
- Missteps in communication can escalate into combat scenario.
- Counselor may offer interpretive insights that prevent catastrophe.

GOAL: Resolve encounter without destruction of Earth. Secure safety of Sol system.

PHASE 6 EXPANDED DETAILS
------------------------
- RESOLUTION PATHS (EXAMPLES):
  * Diplomatic Redirection: Encode a high-confidence route to a distant, uninhabited star emitting a similar spectral profile; requires sustained handshake without power spikes.
  * Technical Lure: Project a synthesized “origin signature” via deflector; draw the entity onto a safe outbound vector; high power draw, risks temporary sensor blackout.
  * Tactical Containment (Last Resort): Coordinated phaser modulation to disrupt sheath while torpedoes detonate at calculated nodes; heavy collateral risk and probable escalation.
- CONSEQUENCE SKETCH:
  * Diplomatic Success: Minimal damage, entity departs; Federation gains a unique first contact entry.
  * Technical Success with Strain: Ship sustains stress, casualties possible, but Sol safe; entity wanders off following lure.
  * Tactical Pyrrhic: Entity repelled but severely damaged ship and crew; political fallout.
- FINAL CLOCK PRESSURE:
  * Under 1 hour: Entity prepares Earth-probe; any misstep risks direct probe of Sol.
  * Under 15 minutes: One decisive action remains before consequences lock in.
- CLOSING SIGNALS:
  * Peaceful: Echo pattern softens, power drain ceases, entity alters course.
  * Hostile/Neutral: Defensive pulses increase; entity disregards hails and continues.

MISSION PROPERTIES
------------------
- TIME PRESSURE: Object’s speed leaves little margin for indecision.
- INFORMATION SCARCITY: Entity is mysterious; multiple stations must be used creatively to uncover facts.
- DANGER: Environmental hazards and system strain provide constant tension.
- NON-LINEAR SOLUTION: Captain must weigh diplomacy, science, and tactical options to achieve resolution.

END STATES
----------
- SUCCESS: Entity diverted/redirected peacefully. Earth safe, crew earns commendations.
- PARTIAL SUCCESS: Entity diverted but damage sustained to ship/crew, reputations strained.
- FAILURE: Entity reaches Earth unopposed, catastrophic outcome. Campaign ends.


APPENDIX A: SIGNAL HARMONICS REFERENCE (EXAMPLES)
-------------------------------------------------
- Base Frequencies: 3.1, 5.0, 8.1, 13.1 kHz (prime-influenced).
- Interval Structures: 2.6s, 4.2s, 6.8s spacings; shortening intervals signal acknowledgement.
- Safe Modulation Window: ±7% amplitude variance; avoid >15% near entity.

APPENDIX B: DAMAGE CONTROL QUICK ORDERS (EXAMPLES)
--------------------------------------------------
- “Ops, shed non-critical power by 5% shipwide; route to shields.”
- “Engineering, isolate nacelle field coils and scrub harmonics.”
- “Security, seal decks 5–7 and stage med teams at corridor junctions.”

----------------------------------------------
1. Indifferent transit (baseline).  
2. Curious echoing (responds to patterns).  
3. Defensive posture (reacts to locks/spikes).  
4. Investigative probing (targets strong signals).  
5. Escalation (pulses that cause drains/feedback).  
6. Withdrawal or redirection (upon successful guidance).
