MISSION SPEC: "Echoes of the Unknown"
=====================================

MISSION PREMISE
---------------
The USS Aegis (refit Constitution-class, NCC-1795) has just completed a major overhaul at Earth Spacedock. 
The player, as Captain, takes command for the ship’s shakedown cruise, but an urgent mission interrupts: 
an anomalous, massive energy signal is approaching Sol at superluminal velocity. Starfleet Command assigns 
the Aegis to intercept and identify the object before it reaches Earth. Time is limited. The mission is 
difficult and designed for immersive, bridge-only play.

BOUNDARIES
----------
- The Captain must remain on the Bridge at all times. Orders are issued to bridge stations or support staff via comms.
- Mission progresses dynamically via information requests, orders, and logical deductions.
- Multiple solutions to certain problems exist, but consequences scale based on risk.

PHASES OF THE MISSION
=====================

PHASE 1: PREPARATION & DEPARTURE
--------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- The ship has just completed refit; systems are untested.
- Engineering reports minor instabilities in the warp core calibration.
- Helm navigation databases must be updated with new sensor inputs.
- Crew readiness is uneven; some departments still running drills.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Engineering may resist immediate departure, citing “not ready.”
- Ops must balance power between warp core stabilization and sensors.
- Security reports unauthorized personnel near shuttle bay (possible saboteur distraction).

GOAL: Bring the Aegis to launch readiness and depart Spacedock efficiently.

---

PHASE 2: INITIAL DETECTION & ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Long-range sensors detect a massive, coherent energy field approaching Sol.
- Object is initially unclassifiable: it appears to be both a vessel and an energy wave.
- Communications attempts produce only feedback echoes.
- Science detects subspace distortions trailing it like a wake.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Power fluctuations when attempting deep scans.
- Ops must prioritize between communications attempts, shields, and detailed sensor sweeps.
- First Officer may caution against premature assumptions.

GOAL: Identify the object’s approximate size, speed, and composition.

---

PHASE 3: PURSUIT COURSE & ENCOUNTER
-----------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Helm must plot intercept course into subspace turbulence caused by the object.
- Navigation systems struggle to lock a safe trajectory; astrometrics may assist.
- Energy readings suggest destructive power if it reaches Earth.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Ship is buffeted by gravimetric eddies (requiring Helm/Engineering coordination).
- Transporter malfunctions due to subspace instability.
- Tactical warns shields drain at increased warp speeds in turbulence.

GOAL: Achieve intercept without disabling the ship.

---

PHASE 4: CLOSE SCAN & FIRST CONTACT
-----------------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Object reveals itself: a colossal, semi-organic vessel shrouded in plasma energy.
- Communications channel triggers automated “response tones” but no language translation.
- Science detects a possible internal structure with artificial geometry.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Proximity drains ship’s power reserves unexpectedly.
- Tactical systems lock on, possibly triggering the entity’s defensive reflex.
- Counselor senses “presence” or intent, warns of non-linear intelligence.

GOAL: Establish peaceful recognition, avoid triggering hostile reaction.

---

PHASE 5: DEEPER PROBING
------------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Probes launched toward the object are absorbed or destroyed by its energy field.
- Science suggests “information exchange” may be possible by modulating signals.
- Engineering proposes risky reroute of deflector dish to transmit high-bandwidth data stream.

COMPLICATIONS:
- Ops must carefully balance energy; power misallocation may disable life support.
- Miscommunication may be interpreted as a threat.
- Security reports internal malfunctions: object’s signal interfering with ship’s computer core.

GOAL: Discover the entity’s true intent and origins.

---

PHASE 6: RESOLUTION
-------------------
SITUATIONS/PROBLEMS:
- Entity reveals fragmented communication: seeks origin world (“home”), confused about “Creator.”
- Becomes clear it is not hostile but unaware of biological life significance.
- Approaching Sol system, object prepares to probe Earth itself.

CHOICE PATHS:
1. Diplomacy: Persuade entity Earth is not its destination, redirect it using encoded stellar maps.
2. Technical: Reconfigure ship’s deflector to project a simulated “signal” that lures it away.
3. Aggression (last resort): Tactical attempt to disable or scatter it (high collateral risk).

COMPLICATIONS:
- Power drain grows critical, ship may be disabled if not managed.
- Missteps in communication can escalate into combat scenario.
- Counselor may offer interpretive insights that prevent catastrophe.

GOAL: Resolve encounter without destruction of Earth. Secure safety of Sol system.

---

MISSION PROPERTIES
------------------
- TIME PRESSURE: Object’s speed leaves little margin for indecision.
- INFORMATION SCARCITY: Entity is mysterious; multiple stations must be used creatively to uncover facts.
- DANGER: Environmental hazards and system strain provide constant tension.
- NON-LINEAR SOLUTION: Captain must weigh diplomacy, science, and tactical options to achieve resolution.

---

END STATES
----------
- SUCCESS: Entity diverted/redirected peacefully. Earth safe, crew earns commendations.
- PARTIAL SUCCESS: Entity diverted but damage sustained to ship/crew, reputations strained.
- FAILURE: Entity reaches Earth unopposed, catastrophic outcome. Campaign ends.
